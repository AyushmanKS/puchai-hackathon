## üöÄ The Problem

In the age of social media, misinformation and "fake news" spread like wildfire on platforms like WhatsApp, causing confusion and harm. It is increasingly difficult for the average user to distinguish between credible information and fabricated claims.

## ‚ú® Our Solution

The **Fake News Verifier** is an AI-powered tool built for the PuchAI assistant that provides users with an instant first-pass analysis of suspicious news headlines or claims. By simply asking the AI to verify a claim, users can get an immediate credibility assessment, helping to curb the spread of fake news directly within their messaging app.
